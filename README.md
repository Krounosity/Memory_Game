# Memory Game

This game has been created as a task for the first year web developing members of **The Technical Club, RCOEM**. The game rules are as follows:
  - There are multiple cards faced away from you such that you are not able to see the front of it.
  - These cards have particular designs (here, emojis) on the side away from you.
  - Each emoji is associated with only two cards.
  - You can turn no more than two cards in one turn.
  - If the cards match, they stay matched, else they turn back again, staying in the same place.
  - If you match all the cards, you win!
